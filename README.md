# Mo++ Dependencies

All 3rd-party dependencies needed to build Mo++ from scratch.

## Overview

Mo++ relies on a large number of dependencies with specific versions for each, and building all of them locally can take a lot of time and effort. To simplify the process, we ship pre-compiled libraries that contain everything necessary for building and developing Mo++. This repo hosts the build scripts that download the source code of the libraries and package them.

## Thanks

We owe a thank you to the [Gaffer](https://gafferhq.org) team and [Blender](https://blender.org) for coming up with the original version of this idea. See [Gaffer's dependencies repo](https://github.com/GafferHQ/dependencies) for more detail on how they implemented this.
